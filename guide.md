# DXF Parser – Comprehensive User Documentation

The DXF Parser is a powerful web‑based tool designed to read, parse, and analyze DXF files. It converts the file’s text into a hierarchical tree structure, making it easy to examine every section, entity, and property within the file. In addition to a rich tree view, the application offers a variety of overlays for advanced analysis, filtering and searching capabilities, and even batch processing of multiple files.

---

## 1. Application Overview

**What It Does:**  
- **Parsing DXF Files:** The app converts raw DXF text into a structured, navigable tree. It supports both full‑file and streamed parsing modes to handle files of all sizes.
- **Tree Visualization:** The parsed data is shown in a grid view where each node represents an entity (e.g., LINE, CIRCLE, SECTION) or a property. Each row includes critical information such as line number, DXF group code, and data content.
- **Deep Analysis Tools:** With overlays like Cloud Data, Statistics, Dependencies, Hex Viewer, and more, users can explore and analyze DXF data beyond just visualizing the structure.
- **Batch Processing:** Quickly search through directories of DXF files for specific entities or property values, and export the results for further review.

**Why Use It:**  
Whether you’re a CAD engineer troubleshooting a DXF file, a developer integrating DXF data into another system, or a data analyst needing to process large sets of CAD files, this tool offers comprehensive insight and control.

## 2. File Parsing & Upload

### File Input Options

**Standard File Upload:**  
- **How It Works:** Use the file input control at the top of the application interface. This control accepts one or multiple files with the “.dxf” extension.
- **When to Use:** Ideal for typical DXF files that are small to moderate in size.
- **User Tip:** Select your file and then click the “Parse File(s)” button to begin processing.

**Drag & Drop:**  
- **How It Works:** Simply drag your DXF file(s) from your file explorer and drop them onto any part of the application window.
- **Benefits:** This method is quick and eliminates the need to manually click the file input.
- **Use Case:** When processing multiple files, drag and drop is particularly convenient.

**Streamed Parsing:**  
- **Feature Description:** A checkbox labeled “Use Streamed Parsing” allows the application to read DXF files in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory.
- **When to Use:** Best for very large DXF files that might otherwise cause the browser to hang or run slowly.
- **Technical Insight:** Streamed parsing uses the file’s ReadableStream interface, processing data line-by-line to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **User Tip:** Enable streamed parsing if you are working with files larger than a few megabytes.

## 3. Tree View & Navigation

### Tree Grid Display

**Hierarchical Data Representation:**  
- **Nodes & Children:** The DXF file is decomposed into a tree. Container nodes (such as sections or blocks) can be expanded to reveal their child entities and properties.
- **Visual Cues:**  
  - **Indentation:** Child nodes are indented to visually reflect the hierarchy.
  - **Toggle Icons:** A clickable arrow (► for collapsed, ▼ for expanded) is present for nodes that contain sub‑nodes.
  
**Columns Explained:**

- **Line Number:**  
  - **Purpose:** Displays the original line number from the DXF file for each node.  
  - **Usage:** Helps trace back to the source document, which is useful when debugging or cross‑referencing the file.
- **DXF Group Code:**  
  - **Purpose:** For property nodes, this column shows the numeric DXF code (for example, 0, 5, 310).  
  - **Usage:** Useful for filtering and understanding the type of data (e.g., handles, layer names, etc.).
- **Data Column:**  
  - **Purpose:** Displays the entity type (like “LINE”, “SECTION”) or the property value.  
  - **Interactive Elements:**  
    - **Clickable Handles:** If the data represents a DXF handle, it is rendered as a link.
    - **Action Buttons:** Buttons like “Copy,” “Open,” or “Hex Viewer” appear on hover.
- **Object Count:**  
  - **Purpose:** For nodes that act as containers, this column shows the number of child objects.  
  - **Usage:** Quickly gauge the complexity or the size of a section.
- **Data Size:**  
  - **Purpose:** Indicates the cumulative size (in characters) of the node’s data and properties.  
  - **Usage:** Helps identify objects that may contain large amounts of data, such as embedded binary streams.

### Interactivity

- **Row Selection:**  
  Clicking on any row selects that node, which can then be copied, opened in a new tab, or navigated to via its handle.
  
- **Column Resizing:**  
  - **How It Works:** Each header has a resizer handle. Click and drag this handle to adjust the column’s width.
  - **Benefit:** Customize the view to focus on details that matter most to you.
  
- **Sorting:**  
  - **How It Works:** Clicking on a header (outside of the resizer) sorts the tree by that column’s values.  
  - **Visual Feedback:** Sort direction is indicated by an arrow (▲ for ascending, ▼ for descending).

**Use Case Example:**  
Imagine you are troubleshooting a DXF file with many sections. By expanding the “SECTION” nodes and sorting by “Line,” you can quickly pinpoint where specific entities start. Adjusting the “Data” column width lets you better read lengthy property values.

## 4. Filtering & Searching

### Filter Panel

**Search by DXF Group Code:**  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Enter a group code (e.g., “5”) into the provided input box.  
  - Once entered (press Enter or comma), the code is converted into a tag.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Filters the tree view to display only those nodes whose properties match the specified DXF group code.
- **Practical Scenario:**  
  - When you want to review all entities associated with handles (commonly group code 5), entering “5” filters the results accordingly.

**Search by Data Value:**  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Enter text into the Data search field (for example, “CIRCLE” or “DIMSTYLE”).  
  - Tags are created as you type, and the tree updates to show only matching nodes.
- **Customization Options:**  
  - **Exact Data Match:** When enabled, the search will return only nodes whose data value exactly matches the input.
  - **Case Sensitive:** When checked, the search differentiates between uppercase and lowercase characters.
- **Use Case:**  
  - A designer looking for all instances of a particular text style can type the style name into the data search field and refine the search by turning on “Exact Data Match.”

**Line Range Filters:**  
- **Input Fields:**  
  - Specify a “Min Line” and “Max Line” to limit your search to a specific portion of the DXF file.
- **Usage Scenario:**  
  - When you suspect an error occurred in a particular part of the file, filtering by line number helps narrow down the area.

**Search & Clear Actions:**  
- **Search Button:**  
  - Applies all active filters to the tree view.
- **Clear Search Button:**  
  - Resets all filter inputs, removes tags, and refreshes the view to show the entire tree.

**Detailed Example:**  
Suppose you’re troubleshooting a block definition error. You might:
1. Enter the group code “2” (for block names) in the Code filter.
2. Type a suspected block name in the Data filter.
3. Set a line range if you know roughly where the block should be.
4. Click “Search” to isolate the block’s definition in the tree.

## 5. Navigation Controls

### Go-to-Handle Functionality

**Direct Navigation:**  
- **How It Works:**  
  - In the “Go to Handle” input box, type the unique DXF handle of an entity (e.g., “ABC123”).
  - Click the “Go” button to have the application automatically expand the relevant sections and scroll to the matching node.
- **Behind the Scenes:**  
  - The app searches the tree for the handle, expands parent nodes, and scrolls the tree view so that the target node is visible and highlighted.
- **Real‑World Scenario:**  
  - If you have a reference from another file or report that mentions a DXF handle, you can quickly jump to the corresponding entity without manually scrolling through the tree.

### Navigation History

**History Management:**  
- **Back/Forward Buttons:**  
  - Use these to cycle through previously visited nodes or handles.
- **Clear History:**  
  - Resets the navigation history, which can be useful after completing an investigation.
- **User Experience:**  
  - This feature provides a web‑browser–like history that allows you to retrace your steps as you navigate through complex DXF structures.

**Example Scenario:**  
After jumping to a specific handle to inspect a section, you might use the “Back” button to return to your previous location, compare sections, and then move “Forward” if necessary.

**Use Case:**  
If a DXF file uses custom classes and you need to validate their definitions, use the Classes Overlay to review and verify each class’s details.

---

### Object Sizes Overlay

**Purpose:**  
- Ranks objects based on the total size of their data (the sum of characters in the type names and property values).

**Functionality:**  
- Displays objects in descending order of size.
- Each row includes a “Show In Tree” button that highlights the corresponding node.

**When to Use:**  
Use this overlay to identify unusually large objects that might be affecting performance or to locate sections with extensive embedded data.

---

### Blocks & Inserts Overlay

**Purpose:**  
- Focuses on block definitions (BLOCK entities) and their corresponding INSERT entities.
  
**Details Provided:**
- Lists each block along with its name (group code 2) and the line where it is defined.
- Shows every insert that references the block, including nested INSERT relationships.
- Navigation links allow for direct tree view location.

**Use Case:**  
When troubleshooting block issues (such as missing definitions or unexpected behavior in inserts), this overlay provides a consolidated view of all block‑related data.

---

### Line Types Overlay

**Purpose:**  
- Summarizes all linetypes (both defined and used) in the DXF.

**How It Works:**  
- Gathers linetype definitions (usually found in LTYPE entities) and compares them against usage in properties (group code 6).
- Displays whether a linetype is “Defined” or “Used Only” and offers a navigation button for each.

**When to Use:**  
Useful for diagnosing drawing issues where an undefined or misreferenced linetype may cause rendering problems in CAD software.

---

### Texts Overlay

**Purpose:**  
- Consolidates all TEXT and MTEXT entities for review.

## 10. Troubleshooting & Tips

**DXF File Not Loading:**  
- Confirm that the file extension is “.dxf.”
- For large files, ensure that “Use Streamed Parsing” is enabled.

**Performance Issues:**  
- If the tree view is slow, try collapsing nodes to reduce the number of rendered items.
- Ensure your browser is updated, as modern browsers handle virtualization more efficiently.

**Navigation and Filtering:**  
- If you cannot find an entity by its handle, double‑check that the DXF file contains valid handle data (group codes such as 5, 330, etc.).
- Adjust search parameters (e.g., toggle Exact Match or Case Sensitive) if your filters yield no results.

**Column and View Customization:**  
- Experiment with column resizing to optimize the view for your data.
- Use sorting on columns like “Data Size” to identify objects that may be causing issues.
